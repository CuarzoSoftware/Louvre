/**
 * @page page_ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1 The ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1
 * protocol list toplevels
 *
 * @section page_desc_ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1 Description
 *
 * The purpose of this protocol is to provide protocol object handles for
 * toplevels, possibly originating from another client.
 *
 * This protocol is intentionally minimalistic and expects additional
 * functionality (e.g. creating a screencopy source from a toplevel handle,
 * getting information about the state of the toplevel) to be implemented
 * in extension protocols.
 *
 * The compositor may choose to restrict this protocol to a special client
 * launched by the compositor itself or expose it to all clients,
 * this is compositor policy.
 *
 * The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
 * "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
 * phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
 * corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
 * only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.
