/**
 * @page page_ext_session_lock_v1 The ext_session_lock_v1 protocol
 * secure session locking with arbitrary graphics
 *
 * @section page_desc_ext_session_lock_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol allows for a privileged Wayland client to lock the session
 * and display arbitrary graphics while the session is locked.
 *
 * The compositor may choose to restrict this protocol to a special client
 * launched by the compositor itself or expose it to all privileged clients,
 * this is compositor policy.
 *
 * The client is responsible for performing authentication and informing the
 * compositor when the session should be unlocked. If the client dies while
 * the session is locked the session remains locked, possibly permanently
 * depending on compositor policy.
 *
 * The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
 * "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the
 * testing phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with
 * the corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes
 * can only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.
 *

 * In response to the creation of this object the compositor must send
 * either the locked or finished event.
 *
 * The locked event indicates that the session is locked. This means
 * that the compositor must stop rendering and providing input to normal
 * clients. Instead the compositor must blank all outputs with an opaque
 * color such that their normal content is fully hidden.
 *
 * The only surfaces that should be rendered while the session is locked
 * are the lock surfaces created through this interface and optionally,
 * at the compositor's discretion, special privileged surfaces such as
 * input methods or portions of desktop shell UIs.
 *
 * The locked event must not be sent until a new "locked" frame (either
 * from a session lock surface or the compositor blanking the output) has
 * been presented on all outputs and no security sensitive normal/unlocked
 * content is possibly visible.
 *
 * The finished event should be sent immediately on creation of this
 * object if the compositor decides that the locked event will not be sent.
 *
 * The compositor may wait for the client to create and render session lock
 * surfaces before sending the locked event to avoid displaying intermediate
 * blank frames. However, it must impose a reasonable time limit if
 * waiting and send the locked event as soon as the hard requirements
 * described above can be met if the time limit expires. Clients should
 * immediately create lock surfaces for all outputs on creation of this
 * object to make this possible.
 *
 * This behavior of the locked event is required in order to prevent
 * possible race conditions with clients that wish to suspend the system
 * or similar after locking the session. Without these semantics, clients
 * triggering a suspend after receiving the locked event would race with
 * the first "locked" frame being presented and normal/unlocked frames
 * might be briefly visible as the system is resumed if the suspend
 * operation wins the race.
 *
 * If the client dies while the session is locked, the compositor must not
 * unlock the session in response. It is acceptable for the session to be
 * permanently locked if this happens. The compositor may choose to continue
 * to display the lock surfaces the client had mapped before it died or
 * alternatively fall back to a solid color, this is compositor policy.
 *
 * Compositors may also allow a secure way to recover the session, the
 * details of this are compositor policy. Compositors may allow a new
 * client to create a ext_session_lock_v1 object and take responsibility
 * for unlocking the session, they may even start a new lock client
 * instance automatically.
