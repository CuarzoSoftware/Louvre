 * https://svgwg.org/specs/paths/
 *
 * After requesting an svg_path object, the client must send zero or multiple 
 * concat_commands if the string exceeds 4096 bytes, which is the default maximum

 *
 * Once all commands are sent, the client must issue a done request, at which point 
 * the SVG path is considered complete. Sending a done request without having previously 
 * sent a concat_command is valid and represents an empty path. 
 *
 * No requests, except for destroy, are accepted after a done event, otherwise, 
 * the already_constructed error is emitted.
 *
 * Sending a destroy request without having sent a done request triggers the incomplete error. 
 *
 * If the final string yield an invalid SVG path, the invalid_commands error is emitted. 
 *
 * The coordinate system of the described path depends on the context in which it is used.
