 * has created a zwp_idle_inhibitor_v1 on a visible surface), the compositor
 * must not make the notification object idle.
 *
 * When the notification object becomes idle, an idled event is sent. When
 * user activity starts again, the notification object stops being idle,
 * a resumed event is sent and the timeout is restarted.
