/*!
 * @brief Representation of a graphical output (where rendering is performed).
 *
 * The LOutput class represents an output where part of the compositor can be displayed. It is typically associated with a computer screen but
 * could also be a window of an X11 or Wayland desktop depending on the selected graphic backend.\n
 *
 * <center><IMG height="250px" SRC="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4lV1LTHBmO-eFywBrL4UhYIRcQbV5bjGB_17FdWFCzjGvnklxwBnXz5hQKOrkRCOegsn6PjnYZNCWk1SjFjwh9t8olEzr3Uwzd3saEt8EKRbbqX0n1f5R7q6r6V9u1t0PUk7BB0teA=w2400"></center>
 *
 * It has virtual methods used to initialize graphical contexts, rendering frames, and adjusting the dimensions of the framebuffer.\n
 *
 * @section Access
 *
 * The graphic backend is responsible for creating each LOutput making a request to the compositor through LCompositor::createOutputRequest().\n
 * You can reimplement that virtual constructor to use your own LOutput subclass.\n
 * The LOutputManager class grants access to all outputs created by the graphic backend through the LOutputManager::outputs() list and notifies 
 * hotplugging events (e.g. when connecting or disconnecting a monitor through an HDMI port).\n
 *
 * @section Initialization
 *
 * By default, outputs are inactive and therefore it is not possible to render on them. To activate an output, it must be added to the compositor
 * using the LCompositor::addOutput() method, this will initialize its rendering thread, graphical context, and invoke the initializeGL() method. Then, every time the
 * repaint() method is called, the next rendering frame will be scheduled and the paintGL() method will be invoked within which you can define your own rendering logic.\n
 * By default, the library initializes all available outputs once the compositor is started in the LCompositor::initialized() virtual method.
 *
 * @warning The library takes care of calling the virtual methods of LOutput. To force the rendering of the next frame, you should use the repaint() method. Calling the repaint() method multiple times during the same frame does not mean that the paintGL() method will be invoked multiple times, it only ensures that it will be invoked in the next frame.
 *
 * @section Modes
 *
 * Each LOutput can have multiple modes. An LOutputMode contains information about the resolution and refresh rate that the output can operate at.\n 
 * You can access the modes of an output with the modes() method and set the desired mode with setMode().\n
 * Generally, outputs use the mode with the highest refresh rate and resolution by default.\n
 * If you change to a mode with a different resolution and the output is initialized, the resizeGL() method will be invoked.
 *
 * @section Context
 *
 * Each output has its own OpenGL context and its own instance of LPainter, which can be accessed with the painter() method.\n
 * You can use the functions provided by LPainter to render colored rects or textures.\n
 * You can also use OpenGL functions and your own shaders/programs if you wish.
 *
 * @section Layout
 *
 * Outputs, like surfaces, have a position and dimensions that allow them to be logically organized in a similar way to how a system settings panel does.\n
 * You can set the position of an output using the setPosC() method.

 *
 * @section Uninitialization
 *
 * If an LOutput is no longer available, or you no longer wish to use it, you must call the LCompositor::removeOutput() method to
 * remove it from the compositor. This will only uninitialize its rendering thread, making it possible to re-initialize it later.\n
 * An LOutput is no longer available when its virtual destructor is invoked (LCompositor::destroyOutputRequest()).
