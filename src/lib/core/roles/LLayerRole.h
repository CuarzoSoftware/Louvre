/**
 * @brief Layer role for surfaces.
 *
 * @anchor llayerrole_detailed
 *
 * The LLayerRole is used by clients to create various desktop shell components such as a wallpaper, panels, docks, notifications, etc.\n
 * It is part of the [wlr_layer_shell protocol](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1).
 * For a comprehensive understanding of each concept, refer to the protocol documentation.
 *
 * @section layer-role-layer Layer
 *
 * LLayerRole surfaces can be assigned to all layers defined in @ref LSurfaceLayer, except for @ref LLayerMiddle .\n
 * This assignment affects the Z-order, determining how the compositor renders them. The list of surfaces created by clients,
 * accessible through LCompositor::surfaces(), reflects the order they should be rendered, from bottom to top.\n
 * It's also possible to retrieve the list of surfaces for specific layers using LCompositor::layer().
 *
 * @note The order of independent layers follows the same sequence as LCompositor::surfaces().
 *
 * @see LSurface::layer(), LSurface::layerChanged() and LSurface::orderChanged().
 *
 * @section layer-role-pos Positioning
 *
 * LLayerRole surfaces are always positioned relative to a specific LOutput, which can be defined by the client at creation time or replaced later with
 * setExclusiveOutput(). If the client does not specify one, exclusiveOutput() is initially `nullptr`. The default implementation of configureRequest() assigns
 * the current cursor output in such cases.
 *
 * Clients can anchor the surface to one or multiple edges of the output, with optional additional margins.\n
 * Position calculation is simplified by utilizing an instance of LExclusiveZone (exclusiveZone()). The property LExclusiveZone::rect()
 * specifies a rect within the output where the surface should be positioned, and it does not always denote an exclusive zone.
 *
 * For example, when exclusiveZoneSize() equals 0, LExclusiveZone::rect() contains the available space for placing the surface, preventing occlusion of other exclusive zones.
 *
 * @see LExclusiveZone and the default implementation of rolePos().
 *
 * @section layer-role-exclusive-zone Exclusive Zone
 *
 * LLayerRole surfaces can define a size from the edge they are anchored to, to be considered as an exclusive zone, requesting the compositor
 * to prevent occlusion by other surfaces. Since each LLayerRole has its own LExclusiveZone instance, the surfaces positions and size is
 * automatically updated as well as the LOutput::availableGeometry() which can be used, for example, to properly configure LToplevelRole or other types of surfaces.
 *
 * Exclusive zones have different levels of priority, which are defined by the order of the LOutput::exclusiveZones() list.
 * The ones first in the list have higher priority, causing lower priority zones to be moved or resized to prevent occlusion.
 * To modify the order of the list, use LExclusiveZone::insertAfter().
 *
 * @note Whenever the LExclusiveZone::rect() changesâ€”due to alterations in other surfaces' exclusive zones,
 *       the configureRequest() function is triggered. Here, the surface size should be readjusted to avoid obstructing
 *       other exclusive zones with higher priority.
 *
 * @section layer-role-size Size
 *
 * Upon creation, clients invoke configureRequest(), where they expect the compositor to configure the surface with an appropriate size.\n
 * During the request, the size() property contains the size desired by the client. If one of its components is 0, it means
 * the compositor should assign it.
 *
 * @see configureRequest().
