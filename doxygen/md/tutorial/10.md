# Chapter 10: Toplevels

As previously discussed, toplevel surfaces represent the typical windows containing a topbar and buttons for close, minimize, and maximize actions. They are perhaps the most common type of surfaces encountered in a compositor during everyday use.

Toplevels can either exist independently or serve as children of other toplevels, such as dialogs. The functionality of toplevels is primarily managed within the Louvre::LToplevelRole class. In this chapter, we will learn how to interact with them and handle their various requests.

### State Flags

Toplevel surfaces can exhibit different states, which are listed in the Louvre::LToplevelRole::State flags enum. Among these states, the most common ones include::

* Louvre::LToplevelRole::Activated: When this flag is set, the toplevel's decorations are highlighted above others. Only one toplevel can be active at a time.

* Louvre::LToplevelRole::Maximized: When this flag is enabled, the toplevel typically removes its decorations and occupies a significant portion of the screen.

* Louvre::LToplevelRole::Fullscreen: Enabling this flag typically results in the toplevel removing its decorations and completely occupying the entire screen, always staying displayed above other surfaces.

* Louvre::LToplevelRole::Resizing: This flag indicates an ongoing interactive resizing session, usually initiated when the user drags one of its corners.

To set the state of a toplevel, you can choose from various Louvre::LToplevelRole::configure() variants. This method also accepts the size you wish to assign to the toplevel. If you pass a size of (0,0), the client can determine its own size. You can retrieve the current toplevel state flags using the Louvre::LToplevelRole::states() property.

It's essential to note that the state of a toplevel doesn't change immediately after calling configure. You must wait for the respective property listener to detect when its state has actually changed. For instance, if you configure a toplevel with the Louvre::LToplevelRole::Maximized flag, you should wait for the Louvre::LToplevelRole::maximizedChanged() event to properly position it.

### Window Geometry

The size of a toplevel is not determined by its surface size but by its window geometry (Louvre::LToplevelRole::windowGeometry()). The window geometry specifies the rectangle within the surface that encompasses the actual toplevel window, excluding its decorative elements like shadows. This is the size you should take into account when configuring it.

### Decorations

By default, clients handle their own toplevel decorations. However, some applications, like Qt applications, implement the [XDG Decoration](https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-decoration-unstable-v1) protocol, allowing the compositor to take charge of drawing the decorations.

It's worth noting that this protocol is still somewhat experimental, and only a limited number of clients support it. Therefore, for the purpose of this tutorial, we will focus on client-side decorations. If you're interested in exploring server-side decorations, you can refer to the **louvre-views** example, which creates macOS-style decorations for toplevels that support it.

### Interactive Events

Clients can request to initiate interactive moving or resizing of toplevels, typically triggered by the user clicking on its top bar or one of its corners. We will explore how to handle these requests shortly.

Let's begin by crafting our own Louvre::LToplevelRole subclass, which we'll name `EToplevel`:

#### src/EToplevel.h

```cpp
#ifndef ETOPLEVEL_H
#define ETOPLEVEL_H

#include <LToplevelRole.h>

using namespace Louvre;

class EToplevel : public LToplevelRole
{
public:
    EToplevel(Params *params);

    void configureRequest() override;
};

#endif // ETOPLEVEL_H
```

Here, we're overriding the virtual method Louvre::LToplevelRole::configureRequest(). This method is invoked when the toplevel is created and every time it's mapped again after being unmapped. Within this method, we should call Louvre::LToplevelRole::configure() to properly adjust the states and size of the toplevel.

#### src/EToplevel.cpp

```cpp
#include "EToplevel.h"

EToplevel::EToplevel(Params *params) : LToplevelRole(params) {}

void EToplevel::configureRequest()
{
    // Request the client to draw its own window decorations
    setDecorationMode(ClientSide);

    // Activates the Toplevel with size (0,0) so that the client can decide the size
    configure(LSize(0, 0), states() | LToplevelRole::Activated);
}
```

In this case, we're requesting the client to use client-side decorations. Additionally, we're configuring the toplevel with a size of (0,0), allowing it to determine its own size. Furthermore, we're adding the Louvre::LToplevelRole::Activated state using the "|" operator. If you're not yet familiar with working with bit flags, you can refer to [this post](https://dietertack.medium.com/using-bit-flags-in-c-d39ec6e30f08) by Dieter Tack for a detailed guide on handling them.

Additionally, don't overlook its virtual constructor.

#### src/ECompositor.h

```cpp
    // ...

    // Virtual constructors
    LOutput *createOutputRequest() override;
    LSurface *createSurfaceRequest(LSurface::Params *params) override;
    LPointer *createPointerRequest(LPointer::Params *params) override;
    LKeyboard *createKeyboardRequest(LKeyboard::Params *params) override;
    LToplevelRole *createToplevelRoleRequest(LToplevelRole::Params *params) override;

    // ...
```

#### src/ECompositor.h

```cpp
// ...

#include "EToplevel.h"

// ...

LToplevelRole *ECompositor::createToplevelRoleRequest(LToplevelRole::Params *params)
{
    return new EToplevel(params);
}
```

After recompiling and running the compositor, you should observe that everything remains unchanged. To explore further, consider configuring the toplevels with different sizes and states to observe their responses.

You may have also noticed that upon creation, all toplevels are automatically centered on the screen. This behavior is a result of the default implementation of Louvre::LSurface::mappingChanged(), which centers them each time they are remapped.

To modify this behavior, let's override the virtual method and introduce a boolean variable in our `ESurface` class. This variable will ensure that the toplevels are centered only during their initial mapping.

#### src/ESurface.h

```cpp
// ...

class ESurface : public LSurface
{
public:

    // ...

    void mappingChanged() override;

    // ...

    bool firstMapping = true;
};
```

We initialize `firstMapping` as `true`, and after the initial mapping, we set it to `false`.

#### src/ESurface.cpp

```cpp
// ...

#include <LCursor.h>

// ...

void ESurface::mappingChanged()
{
    if (mapped() && firstMapping)
    {
        firstMapping = false;

        // We only center toplevels the first time they are mapped
        if (toplevel())
        {
            // Use the output where the cursor is currently located
            LOutput *output = cursor()->output();

            // Restrict the area to the output size - the topbar area
            LSize dstSize = output->size() - LSize(0, TOPBAR_HEIGHT);

            // Center the toplevel
            setPos( (output->pos() + LPoint(0, TOPBAR_HEIGHT)) + (dstSize - toplevel()->windowGeometry().size()) / 2);

            // Prevent positioning it under the topbar (when the toplevel height is greater than dstSize.h())
            if (pos().y() < output->pos().y() + TOPBAR_HEIGHT)
                setY(output->pos().y() + TOPBAR_HEIGHT);

            output->repaint();
        }
    }

    /* The surface view hides when the surface is unmapped, but
     * it doesn't automatically trigger a repaint of the outputs*/
    repaintOutputs();
}

// ...
```

As you may have observed, Louvre::LSurface::mappingChanged() is invoked whenever there's a change in the Louvre::LSurface::mapped() property. In contrast to the default approach, we have improved it by considering the topbar's height when centering. When a toplevel's size exceeds the output size minus the topbar region, we reposition it downward to prevent it from appearing beneath the topbar.

### Interactive Toplevel Movement

Clients have the capability to request the initiation of interactive toplevel movement sessions, typically triggered when a user drags a toplevel window's titlebar. This request is managed within the Louvre::LToplevelRole::startMoveRequest() virtual method. Louvre also provides auxiliary functions for handling these sessions through the Louvre::LPointer class.

To initiate an interactive toplevel movement session, use the Louvre::LPointer::startMovingToplevel() function. This function accepts several arguments, including the target toplevel window you intend to move and the defined constraint area that specifies where the toplevel can be positioned. 

The toplevel's position is then updated by invoking Louvre::LPointer::updateMovingToplevelPos() within a pointer move event, as we previously demonstrated in [Chapter 8](md_md_tutorial_08.html), taking the cursor's position into consideration. 

Lastly, to conclude the session, we call Louvre::LPointer::stopMovingToplevel() when releasing the left pointer button in a pointer button event as we also saw in Chapter 8.

> You are not obligated to employ the Louvre::LPointer auxiliary functions for managing an interactive moving toplevel session. Instead, you can manually update its position using Louvre::LSurface::setPos(), as previously explained.

Let's customize the default behavior of Louvre::LToplevelRole::startMoveRequest() to prevent toplevel windows from being positioned under the topbar.

#### src/EToplevel.h

```cpp
// ...

class EToplevel : public LToplevelRole
{
public:
    
    // ...

    void startMoveRequest() override;
};

// ...
```

#### src/EToplevel.cpp

```cpp
#include <LSeat.h>
#include <LPointer.h>
#include "EToplevel.h"
#include "Global.h"

// ...

void EToplevel::startMoveRequest()
{
    if (!fullscreen() && seat()->pointer()->focusSurface() == surface())
        seat()->pointer()->startMovingToplevel(this, LPointer::EdgeDisabled, TOPBAR_HEIGHT);
}
```

Here, we initiate interactive resizing only when the toplevel has pointer focus and is not in fullscreen mode. Additionally, we impose a constraint on the top edge position by assigning it the `TOPBAR_HEIGHT` macro as the value for the T (top) argument.

It's worth noting that, by default, all edges are disabled. You have the option to disable a specific edge restriction by using the Louvre::LPointer::EdgeDisabled value.

Upon recompiling and running the compositor again, you'll observe that toplevel windows can no longer be positioned under the topbar. However, if you resize them, they can still go behind the topbar. Let's explore how to address this issue.

### Interactive Toplevel Resizing

Much like interactive movement, clients can initiate a resizing session by requesting it through Louvre::LToplevelRole::startResizeRequest(). This is commonly triggered when users drag one of the corners or edges of a toplevel window.

The Louvre::LPointer class also provides auxiliary functions to manage these toplevel resizing sessions. The process begins with a call to Louvre::LPointer::startResizingToplevel(). As the cursor position changes, we invoke Louvre::LPointer::updateResizingToplevelSize(), and each time the toplevel's size changes (handled within Louvre::LToplevelRole::geometryChanged()), we update its position using Louvre::LPointer::updateResizingToplevelPos(). Lastly, upon releasing the left pointer button (implemented in Chapter 8), we call Louvre::LPointer::stopResizingToplevel() to conclude the resizing session.

> It's important to note that both moving and resizing sessions will automatically stop if the toplevel is destroyed. Therefore, you don't need to be overly cautious about handling these situations yourself; the library takes care of this for you.

The Louvre::LPointer auxiliary functions internally configure the toplevel with the Louvre::LToplevelRole::Resizing flag during the session. If you want to handle toplevel resizing sessions manually, you should configure them with that flag and unset it when it finishes.

Let's customize the default behavior of Louvre::LToplevelRole::startResizeRequest() to prevent toplevel windows from being positioned under the topbar.

#### src/EToplevel.h

```cpp
// ...

class EToplevel : public LToplevelRole
{
public:
    
    // ...

    void startResizeRequest(ResizeEdge edge) override;
};

// ...
```

#### src/EToplevel.cpp

```cpp
// ...

void EToplevel::startResizeRequest(ResizeEdge edge)
{
    if (!fullscreen() && seat()->pointer()->focusSurface() == surface())
        seat()->pointer()->startResizingToplevel(this, edge, LPointer::EdgeDisabled, TOPBAR_HEIGHT);
}
```

Just like with the interactive moving session, we ignore the request if the toplevel is in fullscreen mode and if its surface has no pointer focus.

As for Louvre::LPointer::startResizingToplevel(), we pass it the toplevel being resized, the edge or corner being dragged, and also the positioning constraints for each toplevel size. In this case `TOPBAR_HEIGHT` for the top edge to prevent it from being positioned under the topbar.\n
We don't need to override the virtual method Louvre::LToplevelRole::geometryChanged() because it already automatically invokes Louvre::LPointer::updateResizingToplevelPos() for us.

If you recompile and run it again, you will notice that the toplevels no longer position under the topbar while being resized.

> You might observe that **weston-terminal** leaves an empty space between its toplevel window and the top bar when being resized against it. This behavior is due to **weston-terminal** using fixed size steps and is unrelated to Louvre. If you try another client, such as **gedit**, you'll notice that this issue doesn't occur.

Let's now discuss how to handle maximize requests.

### Handling Maximization Requests

Clients can request to maximize their toplevels by using Louvre::LToplevelRole::setMaximizedRequest() and unmaximize them using Louvre::LToplevelRole::unsetMaximizedRequest(). This is typically done in response to user actions such as clicking the maximize button or pressing a keyboard shortcut.

Within these requests, we can configure the toplevels with or without the Louvre::LToplevelRole::Maximized flag and specify the desired size. We then wait for the Louvre::LToplevelRole::maximizedChanged() event to ensure proper positioning.

Now, let's override Louvre::LToplevelRole::setMaximizedRequest() and Louvre::LToplevelRole::maximizedChanged() to configure them with the output size minus the topbar region:

#### src/EToplevel.h

```cpp
// ...

class EToplevel : public LToplevelRole
{
public:
    
    // ...

    void setMaximizedRequest() override;
    void maximizedChanged() override;
};

// ...
```

#### src/EToplevel.cpp

```cpp
// ...

#include <LCursor.h>
#include <LOutput.h>

// ...

void EToplevel::setMaximizedRequest()
{
    // Use the output where the cursor is currently located
    LOutput *output = cursor()->output();

    // Restrict the area to the output size - the topbar area
    LSize dstSize = output->size() - LSize(0, TOPBAR_HEIGHT);

    // Configure the toplevel with active and maximized flags
    configure(dstSize, LToplevelRole::Activated | LToplevelRole::Maximized);
}

void EToplevel::maximizedChanged()
{
    if (!maximized())
        return;

    // Use the output where the cursor is currently located
    LOutput *output = cursor()->output();

    // Restrict the area to the output size - the topbar area
    LSize dstSize = output->size() - LSize(0, TOPBAR_HEIGHT);

    // Center the toplevel
    surface()->setPos( (output->pos() + LPoint(0, TOPBAR_HEIGHT)) + (dstSize - windowGeometry().size()) / 2);

    // Prevent positioning it under the topbar (when the toplevel height is greater than dstSize.h())
    if (surface()->pos().y() < output->pos().y() + TOPBAR_HEIGHT)
        surface()->setY(output->pos().y() + TOPBAR_HEIGHT);

    output->repaint();
}
```

In Louvre::LToplevelRole::setMaximizedRequest(), our approach is straightforward. We configure the toplevel by setting the active and maximized flags while assigning it the size of the current cursor position's output minus the dimensions of the topbar.

Next, in Louvre::LToplevelRole::maximizedChanged(), we center the toplevel within the output, similar to what we did in Louvre::LSurface::mappingChanged().

Upon compiling and running the compositor, you'll notice that the toplevels now maximize properly without going beneath the topbar. Additionally, when you begin moving them, they maintain their maximized size, which aligns with my preferred behavior. However, if you desire a different behavior where they restore their size and position before maximization, that implementation is left to your discretion.

To achieve this alternate behavior, you would need to:

1. Ignore move and resize requests when the toplevels are maximized.
2. Store the position and size of the toplevel before they are maximized.
3. Utilize these stored values to appropriately configure and position them within Louvre::LToplevelRole::unsetMaximizedRequest() and Louvre::LToplevelRole::maximizedChanged() when they are unmaximized.
