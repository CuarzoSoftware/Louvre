# ðŸŽ“ Tutorial {#tutorial_tmp}

This is a work in progress. In the meantime, you can get started by cloning a base template from the following repository:

https://github.com/CuarzoSoftware/LouvreTemplate

It is well-documented and already implements the scene and views system for efficient rendering and basic server-side decorations.

> The old tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/CuarzoSoftware/Louvre/tree/main/doxygen/md/tutorial), however, it is outdated, and many concepts and APIs have changed since then.
