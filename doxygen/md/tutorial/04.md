# Chapter 4: Compositor Initialization

In this chapter, we will explore how to customize the initialization of Louvre::LCompositor. This includes setting up parameters like they keyboard map and output arrangements. This customization will serve as a foundation for overriding the behavior of other classes in upcoming chapters.

To begin, let's create a new Louvre::LCompositor subclass named `ECompositor` (with the "E" prefix denoting "Example Compositor"):

#### src/ECompositor.h

```cpp
#ifndef ECOMPOSITOR_H
#define ECOMPOSITOR_H

#include <LCompositor.h>

using namespace Louvre;

class ECompositor : public LCompositor
{
public:
    ECompositor();

    void initialized() override;
};

#endif // ECOMPOSITOR_H
```

Here, we are overriding the Louvre::LCompositor::initialized() virtual method (click on it to see its default implementation).\n
Louvre calls this method once the compositor has completed its initialization process after we invoke Louvre::LCompositor::start() in `src/main.cpp`.\n
This method is an ideal place to configure and load all the resources required by your compositor.

#### src/ECompositor.cpp

```cpp
#include <LOutput.h>
#include "ECompositor.h"

ECompositor::ECompositor(){}

void ECompositor::initialized()
{
    // Set a keyboard map with "latam" layout
    seat()->keyboard()->setKeymap(nullptr, nullptr, "latam", nullptr);

    Int32 totalWidth = 0;

    // Initialize all avaliable outputs
    for (LOutput *output : seat()->outputs())
    {
        // Set double scale to outputs with DPI >= 200
        output->setScale(output->dpi() >= 200 ? 2 : 1);

        output->setPos(LPoint(totalWidth, 0));
        totalWidth += output->size().w();

        addOutput(output);
        output->repaint();
    }
}
```

Here, we're first configuring the keyboard map with Louvre::LKeyboard::setKeymap(). This keymap helps the compositor interpret raw input key codes as XKB key symbols and ensures clients can correctly understand them as well. 

The method searches for available keymaps on your system based on the provided parameters. If no matches are found, it loads your system's default keymap. In this case, I'm using the Latin American keyboard layout since I'm Chilean. To load your system's default keymap, simply pass `nullptr` for all arguments.

Secondly, we iterate through all available outputs on your machine, those could be your laptop screen, HDMI connector, or others. If an output is considered High DPI (with a DPI greater than or equal to 200), we set its scale to 2 (the default is 1). This adjustment ensures that the content is correctly scaled; otherwise, application windows and UI elements would appear tiny.

Outputs can also be positioned, as you may have done in your system's display configuration panel:

<center>
<img style="max-width:45vw" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AIL4fc8mtBg1aWk8d_9hSa9_sp8V7KYVk6ZskkKgLZ6YP1ouaf-ku7zNndMoASmn2tNsD_2xW7hnHjZgaiLYfFJ-Kbv3SXZhdlGCm-sZamFHsb-Atvo0Kyg=w2400"/><br>
<div style="margin-top:10px;font-style:italic;">Example of a system's display configuration panel.</div>
</center>

In this case, we arrange them from left to right using the `totalWidth` variable. Finally, we initialize these outputs using Louvre::LCompositor::addOutput(), allowing us to render content onto them.

> You can access the complete list of available outputs in your system via Louvre::LSeat::outputs(), and for the list of already initialized outputs, you can use Louvre::LCompositor::outputs(). As the compositor and seat object instances are both static and unique, these can be accessed from any object using `object->compositor()` and `object->seat()`.

Lastly, in `src/main.cpp`, we should replace `LCompositor` with our custom `ECompositor` subclass.

#### src/main.cpp

```cpp
#include <LLog.h>
#include "ECompositor.h"

using namespace Louvre;

int main()
{
    ECompositor compositor;

    if (!compositor.start())
    {
        LLog::fatal("[louvre-example] Failed to start compositor.");
        return 1;
    }

    while (compositor.state() != LCompositor::Uninitialized)
        compositor.processLoop(-1);

    return 0;
}
```

### Rebuilding

As we've added two new files, we'll need to reconfigure the project and then rebuild it with the following commands:

```bash
$ cd project_dir
$ meson setup build --wipe
$ cd build
$ meson compile
```

> Executing `$ meson setup build --wipe` is only required when you add or remove source files in your project.

If you run the compositor again, you may not notice significant changes since Louvre::LCompositor::initialized() by default already performs similar tasks. However, if you've modified the keyboard layout, you should now see the desired improvements.

### Hotplugging Events

After learning how to configure outputs during startup, what happens if we connect or disconnect an output while the compositor is already running?

Louvre handles this automatically by initializing any newly plugged output and de-initializing it when unplugged. This functionality is managed within the Louvre::LSeat class, specifically through its Louvre::LSeat::outputPlugged() and Louvre::LSeat::outputUnplugged() virtual methods. While it's possible to customize these methods, it's not essential to do so at this stage of the tutorial. You can explore this further once you're comfortable working with your own subclasses.

In the following chapters, things are about to get more thrilling as we dive into different ways for rendering content to the outputs.
