# Chapter 13: Cursor

As we have already seen in previous chapters, Louvre features the Louvre::LCursor class, which greatly simplifies cursor rendering on outputs. We have also discussed that certain graphic backends support hardware compositing, providing an efficient means of rendering the cursor without the need for using OpenGL. In this chapter, we will discuss how clients request to change the cursor, and we will also explore how to load cursors from cursor themes installed on your machine.

### Texture and Hotspot

Setting a cursor is pretty straightforward. You can use Louvre::LCursor::setTexture() to assign a cursor. This method takes two arguments: the texture you want to use as the cursor and its hotspot, specified in buffer coordinates relative to the texture size. The hotspot represents the coordinates within the texture to which the cursor image points. For instance, if the image is a cross, the hotspot should be at the center of the texture.

### Position and Size

To adjust the cursor position, you can use **Louvre::LCursor::setPos()**, which takes absolute coordinates as its argument. Alternatively, you can utilize **Louvre::LCursor::move()**, which moves the cursor by a delta (dx, dy) specified in the argument.

If you move it to a position where there is no output, the cursor will automatically relocate to the corner of the closest output. You can access the output where the cursor is currently located with **Louvre::LCursor::output()** and retrieve all the outputs intersected by the cursor using **Louvre::LCursor::intersectedOutputs()**.

When hardware compositing is available, the cursor position is automatically adjusted to the hotspot. In cases where OpenGL rendering is required, the hotspot is also included in **Louvre::LCursor::rect()**, defining the on-screen area where you should render the cursor.

However, the cursor's size is not determined by the dimensions of its texture. To set the cursor's size, you must use **Louvre::LCursor::setSize()**. This function automatically scales the texture and the hotspot proportionally to the specified size. As a result, when you change the texture, the cursor always maintains the same size. The default cursor size is (24, 24) in surface coordinates.

It's important to note that hardware cursors have limited size, guaranteed to be at least (64, 64) in buffer coordinates. If you set the cursor size to dimensions that are too large, it may appear clipped when using hardware composition. In such cases, you should consider rendering it with OpenGL instead.

### Default Cursor

Louvre provides a default arrow cursor texture that you can load by calling **Louvre::LCursor::useDefault()**. This function automatically reverts the cursor to the default texture and hotspot.

If you wish to replace the default texture and hotspot with your own, you have the option to do so using **Louvre::LCursor::replaceDefault()**.

### Client Requests

Clients can request to set the cursor texture and hotspot through **Louvre::LPointer::setCursorRequest()**. To do this, they create a **Louvre::LCursorRole** and pass it as an argument. Alternatively, this argument can be **nullptr**, indicating that the client wants to hide the cursor.

Let's proceed to override that method to observe how Louvre handles it by default:

#### src/EPointer.h

```cpp
#ifndef EPOINTER_H
#define EPOINTER_H

#include <LPointer.h>

using namespace Louvre;

class EPointer : public LPointer
{
public:
    
    // ...

    void setCursorRequest(LCursorRole *cursorRole) override;
};

#endif // EPOINTER_H
```

#### src/EPointer.cpp

```cpp
#include <LCursor.h>

// ...

void EPointer::setCursorRequest(LCursorRole *cursorRole)
{
    if (cursorRole)
    {
        cursor()->setTextureB(
            cursorRole->surface()->texture(),
            cursorRole->hotspotB());

        cursor()->setVisible(true);
    }
    // If `nullptr` is provided, it indicates that the client intends to hide the cursor.
    else
        cursor()->setVisible(false);
}
```

This request is only invoked if the client has one of its surfaces with pointer focus or if it is the originator of a drag & drop session. Within this request, we check if **cursorRole** is **nullptr**. If it's not **nullptr**, we assign the cursor the texture of its surface and the hotspot provided by the role. If it is **nullptr**, we simply hide the cursor.

Louvre also keeps track of the last request. You can access the last **Louvre::LCursorRole** requested using **Louvre::LPointer::lastCursorRequest()**, which may return **nullptr** if the client requested to hide it or if it was destroyed. To distinguish whether the last request was to hide it or not, you can use **Louvre::LPointer::lastCursorRequestWasHide()**.

### Cursor Themes

Louvre also provides functionality to load XCursor icon themes available on your machine. XCursor icons are the standard way cursor icon themes are managed in Linux.

To load an XCursor, you can utilize the static **Louvre::LXCursor::loadCursor()** function. This function takes three arguments: the cursor name, theme, and preferred size. If the cursor is found, it returns an instance of **Louvre::LXCursor**, which contains the cursor texture and hotspot. If the cursor is not found, it returns **nullptr**.

Let's proceed to load an XCursor and set it as the default cursor. A suitable place to do this is within the **Louvre::LCompositor::cursorInitialized()** event, which is triggered once the **Louvre::LCursor** instance is initialized. We will also override **Louvre::LCompositor::uninitialized()**, which is invoked right before the compositor terminates, allowing us to destroy the loaded XCursor.

#### src/ECompositor.h

```cpp

// ...

class ECompositor : public LCompositor
{
public:
    
    // ...

    void uninitialized() override;
    void cursorInitialized() override;

    // Default cursor
    LXCursor *defaultCursor = nullptr;
 
    // ...
};
```

#### src/ECompositor.cpp

```cpp
#include <LXCursor.h>
#include <LCursor.h>

// ...

void ECompositor::uninitialized()
{
    if (defaultCursor)
        delete defaultCursor;
}

void ECompositor::cursorInitialized()
{
    defaultCursor = LXCursor::loadXCursorB("hand1");

    if (defaultCursor)
        cursor()->replaceDefaultB(defaultCursor->texture(), defaultCursor->hotspotB());
}

// ...
```

So, we are currently loading the "hand1" cursor while leaving the other parameters as default. We use **nullptr** for the theme name and specify 64 as the suggested size. Passing **nullptr** as the theme name implies that it will return the icon that matches the name from any theme.

Now, whenever **Louvre::LCursor::useDefault()** is called, it will load the "hand1" cursor. If, after recompiling and running the compositor, you do not see the default cursor as a hand, it could be because you don't have an icon theme with that icon name.

To make your compositor blend better with your system's appearance, it's advisable to load the "arrow" icon as the default cursor instead of using the default provided by Louvre.

If you wish to restore the Louvre cursor as the default, simply pass **nullptr** as the texture in **Louvre::LCursor::replaceDefault()**. This action will restore the default Louvre cursor and its hotspot.

In the next chapter, we will explore how clients can request and exchange information through clipboard and drag & drop sessions. À bientôt!
