# Chapter 1: Introduction

Throughout this tutorial you will learn about Wayland, Louvre's architecture, and master its features to create your own compositor.\n
While prior knowledge of Wayland and some basic experience in C++ are beneficial, explanations will be provided for each concept as necessary.\n
By the end of this tutorial, you will have developed a 2D compositor that closely resembles the one shown in the image below:

This compositor will have the capability to manage multiple screens, move and scale windows interactively using the pointer, transmit keyboard events to them, and alter their states to maximize, go fullscreen, or minimize them to a top bar.

# Chapters

The tutorial is divided in many chapters, we will start by a quick overview of how Louvre works and let you listen to signals and override functionality, then we will see where and how to configure the compositor startup involving selecting the keyboard map and screens, then we will learn how to render contento to the screens using Louvre::LPainter and in another chapter then using the Louvre::LScene and Louvre::LView classes, we will also discuss the benefits of usint whis instead of LPainter, then we will see in depth what are surfaces and how to render them and handle its events such as when they get minimized, then we will see how to handle pointer events from devices like a mouse, touchpad, then keyboard events, then we will see how to handle specific surface roles like Louvre::LToplevelRole, and more.

# Before Proceeding

Before you start, please ensure that you have correctly installed both **Louvre** and **weston-terminal**. You can find detailed installation instructions in the [Downloads](md_md__downloads.html) section.\n
Additionally, for a seamless experience throughout this tutorial, it is recommended to work from a relatively recent Linux distribution with an X11 desktop environment to prevent conflicts between compositors and applications.

If you are currently using a Wayland desktop, please consult the [Environment](md_md__environment.html) section for guidance on configuring the **LOUVRE_WAYLAND_DISPLAY** and **WAYLAND_DISPLAY** environment variables correctly.
