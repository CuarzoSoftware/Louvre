# Chapter 1: Introduction

Throughout this tutorial you will learn about Wayland, Louvre's architecture, and how to use its many features to build your own compositor.\n
No prior knowledge of Wayland or extensive experience in C++ is required, each concept will be explained as needed.\n
Upon completion, you will have developed a 2D compositor similar to the one shown in the image below:

Capable of driving multiple monitors, move and scale windows interactively with the pointer, send keyboard events to them, and change their states to maximized, fullscreen, or show them minimized in a top bar.

# Before continuing

To ensure a smooth experience following this tutorial, it is suggested to work on a Debian or Red Hat based Linux distribution (tested on Debian 11, Ubuntu 22.04.1, Linux Mint 21.1 and Fedora Linux 36) with an X11 desktop environment and use the QtCreator IDE to manage the project.\n
The online Qt installer can be found [here](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source?hsCtaTracking=e9c17691-91a0-4616-9bc2-1a6a6c318914%7C963686f8-2c68-442a-b17b-3d73ce95b819) (remember to check the QtCreator and qmake options during installation).
