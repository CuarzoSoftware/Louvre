Creating a Wayland compositor can be a daunting undertaking, often spanning months or even years of effort. This challenging task involves mastering Linux input and graphic APIs, managing graphic buffers, and meticulously implementing numerous Wayland protocols and their respective interfaces.

Fortunately, Louvre simplifies this intricate process by handling all the complex low-level tasks on your behalf. It even provides a default way for managing protocols, enabling you to have a basic but functional compositor from day one and progressively explore and customize its functionality to precisely match your requirements.
