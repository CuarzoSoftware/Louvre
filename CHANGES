  * Incorporated soversion in meson.build.

  # Minor API Changes

  * The LCompositor loadGraphicBackend() and loadInputBackend() methods now accept const std::string & as an argument instead of const char *.
  * The LToplevelRole appId() and title() methods now return const std::string & instead of const char *.
  
  # Additions

  * Introduce LToplevelRole pendingStates() and pendingSize() methods for querying the last configure() parameters.

Louvre (1.0.0-0)

  # Added

  * Multi-GPU support is now available.
  * Introduction of LObject as the base class facilitates sharing future functionality among classes.
  * Pluggable scene and views system introduced for efficient rendering and handling of input events.
  * New LAnimation class for creating time-based animations.
  * New LTimer class for time-based triggered callbacks.
  * New LResource wrapper class for wl_resource structs; each protocol resource or global now has its own LResource subclass.
  * Developers can add or modify default compositor globals by overriding the LCompositor::createGlobalsRequest() virtual method.
  * New example, louvre-views, a MacOS X lookalike compositor that uses the scene and views system.
  * LOutput framebuffers can now be used as textures.
  * LOutput now supports framebuffer transforms.
  * New LRenderBuffer class for rendering into framebuffers and using them as textures.
  * Added support for XDG Decoration, Presentation Time, and Linux DMA-Buf protocols.
  * Libseat can now be enabled or disabled using the LOUVRE_ENABLE_LIBSEAT environment variable.
  * Single, double, or triple buffering can now be configured using SRM library environment variables.

  # Changed

  * LCompositor::start() method is now non-blocking; developers can control the rate of compositor events processing using the pollable LCompositor::fd() and LCompositor::processLoop() methods.
  * New directory structure for protocol interfaces located in src/lib/protocols.
  * Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_seat global, resolving the Firefox issue where it could only receive pointer events.
  * Clients can now create a wl_data_device for each wl_seat.
  * Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_subcompositor global.
  * Ping() and pong() methods moved from XDG Shell to LClient class.
  * The DRM graphic backend now uses the SRM library.

  # Removed

  * X11 graphic and input backends are no longer supported.
  * LOutputManager class has been eliminated, and its functionality has been integrated into the LSeat class.
