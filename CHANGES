Version: 1.0.0

- New LResource wrapper class for wl_resource structs. Now each protocol resource or global has its own LResource subclass.
- New directory structure for protocol interfaces.
- Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_seat global. This fixes the Firefox problem where it could only receive pointer events.
- Clients can now create a wl_data_device for each wl_seat.
- Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_subcompositor global.
