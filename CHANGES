- New LResource wrapper class for wl_resource structs. Now each protocol resource or global has its own LResource subclass.
- New directory structure for protocol interfaces.
- Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_seat global. This fixes the Firefox problem where it could only receive pointer events.
- Clients can now create a wl_data_device for each wl_seat.
- Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_subcompositor global.
- Moved ping() and pong() functions to LClient class.
- Developers can now modify the default compositor globals overriding the LCompositor::createGlobalsRequest() virtual method.
- The LCompositor::start() function is now non-blocking. Developers can control the rate of the compositor events processing using the pollable LCompositor::fd() and LCompositor::processLoop() fuction.
- The LOutputManager class has been eliminated, and its functionality has been integrated into the LSeat class.
