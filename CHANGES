Louvre v1.0.0-0

Additions:

- Multi-GPU is now always supported.
- Introduce LObject as the base class to facilitate sharing of future functionality among classes.
- Introduce a pluggable scene and views system for eficient rendering and handling of input events.
- New LAnimation class for creating time-based animations.
- New LTimer class for time based triggered callbacks.
- New LResource wrapper class for wl_resource structs. Now each protocol resource or global has its own LResource subclass.
- Developers can now add/modify the default compositor globals overriding the LCompositor::createGlobalsRequest() virtual method.
- New louvre-views example, a MacOS X lookalike compositor that uses the scene and views system.
- LOutput framebuffers can now be used as textures.
- New LRenderBuffer class for rendering into framebuffers and use them as textures.
- Add support for XDG Decoration, Presentation Time and Linux DMA-Buf protocols.
- Libseat can now be enabled/disabled using the LOUVRE_ENABLE_LIBSEAT env.
- Single, double or triple buffering can now be set using the SRM library envs.

Changes:

- The LCompositor::start() method is now non-blocking. Developers can control the rate of the compositor events processing using the pollable LCompositor::fd() and LCompositor::processLoop() fuction.
- New directory structure for protocol interfaces located in src/lib/protocols.
- Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_seat global. This fixes the Firefox problem where it could only receive pointer events.
- Clients can now create a wl_data_device for each wl_seat.
- Clients can now bind multiple times to the wl_subcompositor global.
- Moved ping() and pong() method from XDG Shell to LClient class.
- The DRM graphic backend now uses the SRM library.

Removed:

- X11 graphic and input backends are no longer supported.
- The LOutputManager class has been eliminated, and its functionality has been integrated into the LSeat class.
